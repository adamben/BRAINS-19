# BRAINS-19

Replaces mentions of COVID-19 or Coronavirus on a webpage with "Zombie Apocalypse" or "Zombie Infection" instead.

It's a very simple extension done quickly by someone who never made one. 

Suggested by one Sarah Sawler on Twitter(https://twitter.com/SarahSawler/status/1238092065864585217) to lighten
the thick atmosphere with a bit of dark zombie humour.
